# Python Practice

This is a collection of Python scripts and mini-projects I've written as part of my learning journey. They're organized from basics to intermediate-level practice, and include small challenges and project ideas.

## Structure

- `01_basics/` – Simple Python syntax, variables, loops, functions
- `02_intermediate/` – File I/O, error handling, dictionaries, etc.
- `03_projects/` – Mini-projects like calculators, games, data parsers
